Before the music industry became a part of everyday life, Maria worked with television production. She still works with television between releases and promotions as a director on various productions. Concerts, travel, and artist development are a big passion for Maria. She started with promotion and soon got responsibility for several other areas in the company. In 2020 she also became manager to the Norwegian artist «Bølgen». Besides MTG Music, Maria is also working for FONO, Norway's Independent Record Company association, the last seven years as a coordinator. In the last two years, she has also been involved in developing and starting FONO Development. FONO Development aims to help put FONO and the Norwegian indie industry on the map, both home and abroad. The group works to influence and improve the conditions of FONOs members and the indie industry and help initiate and lead discussions and debates about the industry's most important and relevant challenges. FONO Development consists of an equal number of women and men. A few years ago, the group also created ""FONO WOMEN"" as an initiative for FONO's female members. They wanted to make an arena for everyone to get to know each other, learn from each other and be a place to network. Feedback from others in the industry, and experiences the group has done themselves, have contributed to the fact that in the extension of FONO Women, there has clearly been a need and desire to start a Norwegian chapter of shesaid.so.`,
