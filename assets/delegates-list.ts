FONO Development aims to help put FONO and the Norwegian indie industry on the map, both home and abroad. The group works to influence and improve the conditions of FONOs members and the indie industry and help initiate and lead discussions and debates about the industry's most important and relevant challenges. FONO Development consists of an equal number of women and men. A few years ago, the group also created ""FONO WOMEN"" as an initiative for FONO's female members. They wanted to make an arena for everyone to get to know each other, learn from each other and be a place to network. Feedback from others in the industry, and experiences the group has done themselves, have contributed to the fact that in the extension of FONO Women, there has clearly been a need and desire to start a Norwegian chapter of shesaid.so."`,

      female or non-binary artist should be a matter of course and not a vision.
      Ivy Ofori works also with project management and booking among the venue Mejeriet in Lund (SE), and previous in different projects for
      Roskilde Festival and Popkollo Malmö. The inspiration for founding Pink Ivy Management comes from Ivy's experiences in
      the industry where she in roles as producer, organizer and artist manager has seen certain needs approaching: I believe
      that the key to promoting female /non-binary artists lies in a certain, inclusive management style, especially for those
      artists who are surrounded by a completely male crew and band. Having the ""female view"" on the big parts of the business
      like live crew, management and recording sets things in another perspective. Previously Pink Ivy Management has worked
      with artists like Arre! Arre!, Loljud, Feivel, Sophia Tako, Sallyswag, Aurelia Dey, GNUCCI, Ninoosh and Mi von Ahn."`,
