Since 2016 we have been putting on club and concert nights on a nearly monthly basis and the festival Jungelfest each January. Our musical profile is rooted in music from Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean – but we also love to present new jazz and hiphop stuff.

      We're proud of being the first in Norway to present artists such as Athletic Progression (DK), Habibi Funk (DE), Oswèla (FR), Triorität (DE), Miss Tatis Angola 70 (NO), Faratuben (MALI/DK), Stella & The Longos (FR), Hadj Sameer (Algerie), Tchiss Lopes (Cape Verde) etc.

      I am definitely more of a community guy than a music business guy and I've been enjoying spending almost two years in France (Montpellier and Paris) and travels to the Caribbean and Latin America. These trips has been really helpful for me while building my community in Bergen and bringing artists to Norway.

      The last few years I have been based in my hometown Bergen, on the west coast of Norway, where I recently started a small cultural hub in Nygårdsgaten 33, where we have our office, workshops and events. Many young musicians, dj's and dancers uses the space for their own projects and collabs. I also run Jungelens sister organization, Foreningen JUNG, that offers a meeting space for young people in Bergen (13-26 years) through dance- and dj-workshops.

      Looking forward to link up!

      Manny managed the premier Tuareg music group, Tinariwen, and in 2001, he co-founded the world renowned “Festival in the Desert” of Essakane / Timbuktu. As Executive Director of the Festival Au Desert, he organized the last live version in 2012. When violent extremists banned music in Timbuktu, the Festival was reborn as a “Festival in Exile”.
      Ansar’s fight for the promotion of Malian music has earned him the “Freemuse Award” for the role played by the Festival in the Desert in the fight for freedom of expression by artists in the crisis in Mali."
      Since 2014, Manny has been a co-president of the Timbuktu Renaissance whose aim is to support Mali’s recovery from conflict through a focus on her culture. The Timbuktu Renaissance brought live concerts back to Timbuktu, and organizes  concerts for peace throughout Mali and in neighboring countries. The Timbuktu Renaissance partnered with Google Arts and Culture to create the Mali Magic web platform.

      "I’m making an effort not to define my style but rather be who I am, which is a mix of several identities". A Berber mother from Algeria, and an Italian and Savoyard father is what makes up the DNA of this young woman. With the heritage of the Mediterranean and the Alps, she has a burning heart and a cool head. A duality that we find in her texts, which mixes fear of love and carnal passions.
      This is also one of Brö's specificities. Her crude writing using male codes describes her conquests and pleasures. If the tone is voluntarily cynical, Brö's universe is also full of humor. Holding a master's degree in law and criminology, Elisa enjoys flirting with morality and deconstructing good morals. To live freely, once again, and break the norms.`,

A remnant of the civil war, the film collaborates with artists to perform acoustic improvisations within the space, adapting their approach to suit its particularly long reverb, and in the process evoking similarities between the state of the dome and that of a Lebanon in crisis. The film is in post-production with a release expected in August 2024.

      Additionally, and continuing with his interest in exploring the relationship between space, sound and identity, Anthony has developed his musical practice around improvising in abandoned man-made spaces that exist as a result of wars, or due to man-made consequences pertaining to socio-economic or political changes.

      He is the producer and co-creator of "Maabar," a podcast docu-series that examines the Lebanese civil war through individual memories and personal testimonies, aiming to present a multi-perspective narrative of the conflict.
